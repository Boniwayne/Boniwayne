The ultimate goal of coding is to solve human problems. My all time dream with coding is to learn C, C#,C++,python, Java and also DBMs(Mysql).

Since I am a certified Statistician ,fully knowledgiable in R programming, I want to use my Python and Sql in data manipulation, data extraction and drawing out my conclusions in data analysis.

I also like to participate with other programmers to learn and share knowledge.
